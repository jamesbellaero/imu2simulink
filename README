First install all the stuff for MTSDK from https://www.xsens.com/download/MT/4.8/MT_Software_Suite_Linux_4.8.tar.gz
Note this requires gcc/g++ 4.7 (not 4.6, not 4.8)

Then compile with 'make'

run ./imu2simulink 

To write imu data, it requires that you send a '1' to 127.0.0.1:26100
By default, opens /dev/ttyUSB0 at 115200 Hz and writes to 127.0.0.1:26016 through 127.0.0.1:26022
Writes an int to the first port, acceleration as doubles to the next 3 ports, and gyro as doubles to the last 3.
