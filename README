First install all the stuff for MTSDK from https://www.xsens.com/download/MT/4.8/MT_Software_Suite_Linux_4.8.tar.gz
Note this requires gcc/g++ 4.7 (not 4.6, not 4.8)
Also note that the lab has in depth documetnation for setting up the BeagleBone itself.

Then compile with 'make'

run ./imu2simulink 


By default, opens /dev/ttyUSB0 at 115200 Hz and writes to 127.0.0.1:26016 through 127.0.0.1:26022
Writes an int to the first port, acceleration as doubles to the next 3 ports, and gyro as doubles to the last 3.

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
-p <port number>: Specify the lowest port for imu data sending
-P <port number>: Specify the receive port for the enable signal
-w              : Wait until an enable signal is received to start sending data
-q              : Output delta-V and delta-Q rather than acc and gyro. Outputs to 4 ports rather than 3.
-l              : Logging to ~/imu_data/data_imu.txt
-r <rate>       : Operation rate (up to 100 Hz)

To write imu data with -w, you must send a '1' to 127.0.0.1:26100 (or whatever is specified by -P <###>)
